Linked list does not have indexes.
It is not contiguous in memory like list

# BIG O
*Inserting node at the  end is 0(1) as we can just add element and move 
tail poniter to next node.
*Inserting node the begining is O(1) as we can just make new node point to head
and make new node head. 
*Inserting node at middle is O(n) as we have to traverse the linked list and Insert
a new node in between 2 nodes. 

*Deleting from end is O(n) as we have to travese all nodes so that we 
can make second last node tail.
*Deleting from end is O(1) as we can just make node next to head as head node.
*Deleting from middle is O(n) as we have to delete a node and change its previous node next to its next node.

Traversing is O(n)
